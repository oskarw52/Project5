# Web Development Project 5 - Illinois breweries

Submitted by: Oskar Wolny

This web app: Uses Open Brewery DB Api to fetch data about 200 breweries located in Illinois. The user can then filter and search the data to find what the local breweries are

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
- [X] **Data uses the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax**
- [X] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data such as**
  - [X] *Count of unique cities with breweries*
  - [X] *Average breweries per city*
  - [X] *City with the most breweries*
- [X] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [X] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [ ] Filters use different input types such as a text input, a selection, or a slider

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I think finding the right API to use for this project took me some significant time and then figuring out the conditional rendering with use effect was pretty difficult too. At one point my initial render was not working but all rerenders were which gave me a headache.
